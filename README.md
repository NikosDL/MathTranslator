### Math Translator

## Project Goal 
To create a locally-run app used for streamlining of writing mathematical expression using LaTeX and exporting them into pdf. No commercial intent.

## Structure
The user is able to add custom simplified commands which are then translated to proper LaTeX syntax. A live preview shows the current input in its final form. 

## Dependencies: TBD
Currently: 
- Java SE 22
- JavaFX 22.0.2

## Status: Work in progress
Current sub-objective: Implement Java-LaTeX interface

### Completed sub-objectives:
- Basic GUI structure
- Ability to add, remove and save simple custom translations (saved in txt form)
